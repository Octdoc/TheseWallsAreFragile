Some fixes were made after the end of the gamejam due to bugs and poor design. The gamejam edition code is under the gamejam-edition branch.

Building:
The "fcwymt" and "something" projects are .dlls, the "TheseWallsAreFragile" is the .exe. For the game to work the "Media" folder (found in "Edition with fixes" folder) needs to be in the same folder as the .exe. The rest of the files int the "Edition with fixes" folders are also necessary to play the game but not for running the .exe.
